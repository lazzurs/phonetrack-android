# R8 rules for release builds (isMinifyEnabled in app/build.gradle.kts).
#
# Components declared in the manifest and classes referenced from layout / preference XML
# are kept automatically; AndroidX, Gson, Conscrypt and Nextcloud SSO ship their own rules.

# Readable stack traces in crash reports and the in-app system log: keep line numbers,
# and map them back with the mapping.txt attached to each release.
-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable
-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile

# Libraries without consumer rules that load classes or resources by name.
# There is no instrumented test run of a minified build, so keep them whole rather
# than guess: the size cost is small next to the risk of breaking maps or TLS on device.
#   osmdroid: tile providers and modules

#   mapsforge: render themes (XML) and the map file reader
